    HYMN_ONE: {
      NAME: 'The church’s one foundation',
      HYMN: `
1  The church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord ;
She is His new creation
By water and the Word :
From Heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride ;
With His own blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.

2 Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth ;
Her charter of salvation----
One Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy Name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food ;
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

3 Though with a scornful wonder
Men see her sore opprest,
By schisms rent asunder,
By heresies distrest :
Yet saints their watch are keeping,
Their cry goes up, How long ?
And soon the night of weeping
Shall be the morn of song.

4 'Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumults of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace for evermore ;
Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great church victorious,
Shall be the church at rest.

5 Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won:
Oh, happy ones and holy !
Lord, give us grace, that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly,
On high may dwell with Thee !

    HYMN_TWO: {
      NAME: 'I’ve a message from the Lord Hallellujah',
      HYMN: `
1  I've a message from the Lord, Hallelujah !
The message unto you I'll give;
'Tis recorded in His Word, Hallelujah !
It is only that you look and live.

Chorus
Look and live, . . . my brother, live ! . . .
Look to Jesus now and live ;
'Tis recorded in His Word, Hallelujah !
It is only that you look and live !

2 I've a message full of love, Hallelujah !
A message, O my friend, for you ;
Tis a message from above, Hallelujah !
Jesus said it----and I know 'tis true !

3 Life is offered unto thee, Hallelujah !
Eternal life thy soul shall have,
If you'll only look to Him, Hallelujah !
Look to Jesus, who alone can save

    HYMN_THREE: {
      NAME: 'What a friend we have in Jesus',
      HYMN: `
1
What a Friend we have in Jesus,
  All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
  Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
  O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
  Everything to God in prayer!

2
Have we trials and temptations?
  Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
  Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
  Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
  Take it to the Lord in prayer.

3
Are we weak and heavy-laden,
  Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge—
  Take it to the Lord in prayer;
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
  Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He’ll take and shield thee,
  Thou wilt find a solace there.
